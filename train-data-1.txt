bear that disclaim in mind here s mine thei make monei from sell box set thei re glad to make some version avail for almost unrestrict distribut not for valu via cd duplic or the internet that thei estim won t substitut for box set sale for exampl thei could have packag what i call the ftp edit in isonumb imag the fact that thei didn t suggest to me that thei see the inconveni of mirror ftp edit

iso imag instead thei alwai keep it sever version behind thi again seem like an incent to bui a box set after evalu suse via the iso imag again the abov is my specul onli about their motiv all we know of a certainti is what permiss thei ve grant which ar a bit messi and complex but nonetheless quit clear those permiss as a remind appli to the suse produc compon yast yastnumb the distribut instal program and possibl other util that i don t know of thei wrote that code and have everi right to grant or withhold permiss as suit them best on can suspect what on like what i didn t understand wa that suse had proprietari extens that it wasn t prepar to allow peopl to us under the gpl or even under a freebsd style licenc hmm let s slow down here there s a persist misconcept that it s possibl to place somebodi els s work under a new licenc without hi permiss not so there is noth in copyright law that would make that possibl the copyright owner ha inher right in hi e g softwar work and is entitl to issu as mani instanc of hi code under divers licenc as he wish if he give you a copi with no licenc statement there s effect a default licenc by oper of copyright law to avoid go into a long digress let me just sai that it s a proprietari licenc by default that s why in order to have open sourc softwar at all there must be an explicit licenc from the copyright holder no linux distribut ever entail relicens peopl s softwar without their explicit permiss sinc no such relicens can occur at all you cannot get awai with take suse linux ag s work and redistribut it under what you claim to be a bsd licenc or the gpl or anyth at all other than what the copyright owner ha specifi becaus you simpli lack the right to do so claim to do it would be copyright violat i thought that the model for the like of suse wa sell support and customis rather than what i thought of as the core product i thought that the like of yast came under core mayb it work in the glori dai befor sai number i can understand that thei might want to make more monei but the wai in which thei have done it seem to me to be be against the spirit of the gpl if stallman and friend at the gpl let alon linu torvald and kernel contributor had intend to prohibit put gpled work on the same cd as proprietari on and sell the result onli via retail store plu mail order etc in shrink wrap box i m number certain thei could and would have done so guess what thei did not thei didn t even requir that anybodi give you copi of the gpled compon ever at all all thei did wa requir that if you receiv gpled softwar lawfulli then you had to be abl to get match sourc code for a limit period upon request spirit of the gpl you sai i d suggest that stallman and compani knew exactli what thei were do and that the degre of access to

0 i got to see powel talk in march number at the begin of hi reign at the fcc he said thei were go to take a real hand off approach so it s funni that thei would blame the regul for caus the collaps

though i disagre with him on mani issu i think he s right to resist the old dichotomi the telecom collaps should be a humbl experi for anyon who went through it the disast wasn t the regul fault as some conserv argu but someth clearli went horribl wrong and polici maker should learn from that experi contrari to lemann s specul the upstart carrier won t be success in a gore administr becaus it s too late virtual all of them ar dead and wall street ha turn off the capit tap for the forese futur some mai surviv but as small player rather than world domin the battl between clec and rboc that

lobbi over piec of legisl which most peopl outsid f c c world probabl felt it wa safe to ignor although the telecom act sail under the rhetor banner of modern and deregul it essenc wa a grand interest group bargain in which the local phone compani known to headlin writer as babi bell and to f c c world as arbock the pronounc version of rboc or region bell oper compani would be permit to offer long

competit in local servic while get even more competit than thei alreadi had in long distanc but the polit and econom of the telecom act which wa shepherd through congress by vice presid gore were just as import democrat saw the act as help to reposit them as the technolog partyh parti that brought the internet into everi home creat hundr of thousand of job in new compani and not least set off an

artfulli sent differ messag to differ constitu were the rhetor correl of the telecom act and gore s cruis to the presid wa suppos to be power substanti by the act s success the f c c had a crucial

emerg thi entail the regulatori equival of hand to hand combat the see leck is suppos to have access to the arbock s switch equip the arbock won t give the seeleck a kei to the room where it s kept so the see leck ask the f c c to rule that the arbock ha to give it the kei partli becaus hundt assur the see leck and other new compani that he would protect them and partli becaus of the gener boom

system benefit from the telecom boom demand for their product wa suppos to come from the see leck and other new player there would be no conflict between the interest of the new telecom compani and those of consum as on of hundt s former lieuten told me reed us to joke that my job wa to make sure that all price went down and all stock went up the year follow the passag of the telecom act were the peak of the boom wall street had it blood up and that meant not just more startup but also more merger of exist commun compani time warner and aol decid to throw in togeth and a t t and comcast and so on sure worldcom and the other telecom bad gui believ that their self deal stock oversel and creativ account would go unnot becaus the market wa so undiscrimin by the time the outcom of the

govern regul three republican emerg as candid powel who wa a commission harold furchtgott roth the farthest to the right commission and patrick wood the head of the texa public util commiss and as such a georg w bush gui in texa howev wood had cross the most power person in the arbock camp edward whitacr the c e o of s b c commun which is headquart in san antonio thi meant that the arbock didn t want wood as head of the f c c becaus he might be too pro see leck wood is now the head of the feder energi regulatori commiss michael powel had to signal the arbock that he wasn t as threaten as wood while also signal the conserv movement that he wa onli neglig farther to the left than furchtgott roth powel did thi deftli for exampl in decemb of number he appear befor a conserv group call the progress freedom foundat and gave a veri michael powel speechhims intellectu and free associ biblic histori joseph schumpet moor s law hat began by make fun of the idea that the f c c should try to keep new telecom compani aliv in the wake of the number act the f c c is often cast as the grinch who stole christma powel said like the who down in who vill who feast on who pud and rare who roast beast the commun industri wa prepar to feast on the deregulatori fruit it believ would inevit sprout from the act s fertil soil but thi feast the f c c grinch did not like in the least so it is thought thu powel wa indic that if he becam chairman he didn t expect to administ first aid to the see leck as part of the job he wa appoint to the chairmanship on the first dai of the bush administr twenti month into the administr nearli all the see leck ar dead or dy nearli all long distanc compani not just worldcom ar in seriou troubl cabl compani have lost half their valu satellit compani ar stagger the crash ha had an automat concentr effect becaus as new compani die the exist compani market share increas and if the exist compani ar in good shape financi thei have the opportun to pick up damag compani at bargain price dure the bush administr as the financi carnag in commun ha worsen the commun industri ha move in the direct of more concentr if the bell wind up protect their region monopoli in local phone servic and if thei also merg the countri will be on it wai to have a nation duopoli in local servic verizon in the east and s b c in the west and these compani could domin long

to share their wire with other compani and so can more fulli control what materi thei allow to enter peopl s home as part of the complic bargain with interest group that led to the number telecom act the limit on concentr in the radio industri were significantli loosen and in the past six year the number of radio station owner in the unit state ha been cut by twenti five per cent todai a larg portion of local and nation radio new program is suppli by a singl compani westwood on a subsidiari of viacom in thi situat mani democrat and liber think the f c c should be hyperactiveh superhero of

otherwis restrain the forc of concentr it should us the govern s monei and muscl to get new technologyspeci fast internet connectionsnto the home of peopl who can t afford it at current market price an analog that a lot of peopl in f c c world make is between telecom and the middl east the clinton peopl blame the bloodsh on the bush peopl becaus thei disengag when thei came into offic and the bush peopl blame it on the clinton peopl becaus thei rais too mani expect and stir too mani passion but michael powel s f c c ha not been hyperact powel ha been conduct intern polici review and reform the manag of the f c c and wait for the feder court and the congress to send him signal in mid septemb powel final initi a formal review of the f c c s limit on media concentr thi doesn t mean he ha been inact rather he ha been activ in a wai that further infuri hi criticsn a manner that smoothli blend the genial and the provoc he muse about whether the fundament premis of f c c world realli make sens while give the impress that he s have the time of hi life as chairman at hi first press confer when he wa ask what he wa go to do about the digit divid hat is econom inequ in access to the internet said you know i think there is a merced divid i d like to have on and i can t afford on at the nation cabl telecommun associ convent in chicago powel follow a troup of tumbler to the stage interrupt hi walk to the podium to perform a somersault not long ago i went to see powel in hi offic at the f c c until number when the commiss move to a new build in southwest washington near the citi s open air fish market f c c world wa at the western edg of downtown where everybodi would encount everybodi els at a few familiar restaur and bar todai the f c c build look like the offic of a mortgag compani in a suburban offic park even the chairman s suit though larg is beig carpet and fluoresc powel is a bulki man who wear gold rim glass and walk with a pronounc limp the result of injuri he suffer in a jeep accid in germani in number when he wa an armi offic becaus of the accid he left the armi and went to law school where he becam entranc with conserv idea about regul particularli the idea that the govern rather than try to correct the flaw of the market befor the factprophylact as he like to sayhould wait till the flaw manifest themselv and then us antitrust litig to fix them he work briefli at a corpor law firm and then becam a protof joel klein the head of the antitrust divis of the clinton justic depart and the man who led the govern s legal case against microsoft he wa recent appoint chancellor of the new york public school system it testifi to powel s polit skill that he is probabl the onli high offici in the bush administr who not onli serv in the clinton administr but also maintain close ti to bush s nemesi senat john mccain of arizona on of the thing about powel that annoi peopl is hi endur love of law schoolit s sort of like a law school studi session over there on democrat former commission said as if to confirm the charg powel when i arriv introduc me to four law student summer intern at the commiss whom he d invit to sit in i began by ask powel whether he agre with the found assumpt of the f c c for exampl could privat compani have apport the airwav among themselv without the govern be involv i think we ll never know powel said i don t think it s an automat bad idea the wai some peopl will argu land is probabl the best analogu we don t seiz all the land in the unit state and sai the govern will issu licens to us land if my neighbor put a fenc on foot onto my properti line there s a whole bodi of law about what i can do about that includ whether i can tear it down if a wireless compani wa interf with anoth wireless compani it s a similar proposit there ar scholar who arguende the famou ronald coas treatis that won the nobel prize wa about thishat spectrum polici is lunaci the market could work thi out in the kind of wai that we re accustom to talk to powel wa fun unlik most high govern offici he doesn t seem to be invest in appear dignifi or command he slump in hi chair and fiddl with hi tie and riff he speak in iron air quot he s like your libertarian friend in colleg who enjoi stai up all night ask impertin rhetor question about aspect of life that everybodi els take for grant but that he see as sentiment or illog after a while i ask him whether he thought hi predecessor excit about the number telecommun act had been excess i would start with a caveat powel said look i can t fault those judgment in and of themselv given the time and what peopl thought thei were not the onli on who were hyster about the opportun but frankli i ve alwai been a littl bit critic first of all anybodi who work with the act know that it doesn t come anywher close to match the hyperbol that wa associ with it by the presid on down about the kind of thing it s go to open up i mean i don t know what provis ar the inform superhighwai provis or what provis ar so digit orient or some of the thing that were a big part of the theatr of it introduct when on start read the detail on search often in vain for these provis but nonetheless there wa a rise dot com excit and an internet excit and peopl thought thi wa histor legisl and it certainli wa but we were suck helium out of balloon with the kind of expect that were be bandi around and thi is befor the economi or the market even get in troubl it wa a dramat exagger expectationi the leadership of the commiss by politician by the market itself by compani themselv it wa a gold rush and led to some veri detriment busi decis on that govern encourag by it polici frankli everybodi want to see number go up on the board powel began imit an imagin true believ in the telecom act i want to see ten competitor twenti competitor i want to see thirti per cent market share fifti per cent market share i want the bell to bleed then we ll know we ve succeed now powel return to be powel i think that expect wa astonishingli unrealist in the short term thei want to see it while thei re there we were start to get drunk on the juic we were drink and the market wa get drunk on the juic we were drink there s no question we went too soon too fast too mani compani took on too much debt too fast befor the market realli had a product or a busi model how could the telecom act have been handl better we could have chosen polici that were less hellbent on a singl object and were slightli more balanc and put more econom disciplin in the system powel said monei chase what seem like govern promis opportun the problem with that is there s a morn after and we re in it and the problem is there is no short fix for thi problem thi debt is go to take year to bring down to a realist level in some wai for short term gain we paid a price in long term stabil powel went on to sai that it might have turn out differ if there had been a more reason level of invest no we wouldn t have everi home in america with competit choic yetut we don t anywai i don t think it s the remonopol of telephon servic i don t bui that the bell will prosper but did anybodi believ thei wouldn t the part of the stori that didn t materi wa that peopl thought so would mci worldcom and sprint other local phone compani he ad hadn t materi as viabl busi either and thei never might everybodi s alwai sai the regul did thi and thi and thi but candidli the stori s quit the opposit i think the regul bent over backward for six year to give them a chanc condit don t get that good except onc everi thirti year and it didn t happen so whatev the reason we re look at a worldcom that s teeter we re look at a long distanc busi that ha had a rapid declin in it revenu base a t t is break itself up sprint ha struggl could the f c c have done anyth to make the long distanc compani stronger at the f c c i think i ll just be blunt my polit answer ye there s all kind of thing we can do at the margin to try to help but i can t find thirti billion dollar for worldcom somewher i can t mitig the impact of an account scandal and an s e c investig were i king it would be wonder but i don t have those kind of lever i don t know whether anybodi doe at some point compani ar expect to run themselv in a wai that keep them from dy powel couldn t have made it much clearer that he doesn t think it s hi respons to do anyth about the telecom crash he ha demonstr hi sure polit touch by make accommodationist gesturesn august for exampl five month after disband the f c c s account safeguard divis powel announc that he wa appoint a committe to studi account standard in the commun industri but that show that powel is better at ride out the storm than sai harvei pitt hi counterpart at the secur and exchang commiss and doe not mean that he plan to try to shore up the telecom industri i ask powel if it would bother him if for most peopl onli on compani provid cabl televis and onli on provid local phone servic ye he said it concern us that there s on of each of those thing but let s not diminish the import of there be on of each of those thing that still is a nice suit of commun capabl even if thei aren t direct analogu of each other anywai powel said befor long the phone compani will be abl to provid video servic over their line and the cabl compani will provid data servic over their line so there will be more choic so yeah we have thi anxieti we have on of everyth the question is doe it stai that wai the concentr of ownership and the concentr control of inform did not appear to troubl powel either he said that peopl confus big which bring mani benefit with concentr which distort market if thi were just econom it s easi if you were to sai to me mike just worri about econom concentr we know how to do thath econometr of antitrust i can tell you when a market s too concentr and price ar go to rise the problem is other dimens like polit ideolog sometim emot take the question of if everybodi s control what you see the assumpt there is that somehow there ll be thi viewpoint a monolith viewpoint push on you by your media and you won t get divers i think that s a possibl i don t think it s nearli the possibl that s ascrib to it sometim powel explain sometim when we see veri point polit or parochi program it get attack as unfair i see some of the same peopl who claim thei want divers go crazi when rush limbaugh exist thei love divers but somehow we should run howard stern off the planet if it ha a point of view then it becom accus of bia and then we have polici like er hi tone went from iron to sarcasticth fair doctrin which seem to me like the antithesi of what i thought those peopl care about so when somebodi is point and opinion we do all thi stuff in the name of journalist fair and integr or whatev to make them balanc it out f c c world abound in theori about michael powel on is that he can t make up hi mind about how to address the crisi in the industri he regulateso he talk and talk and talk flamboyantli about the market in order to bui himself time anoth is that he s carri water for the arbock and the big cabl compani anoth is that he is plan to run for the senat from virginia or to be appoint attornei gener in a second bush term and doesn t want to do anyth at the f c c that would diminish hi chanc anoth is that he s wait to move until there is more consensu on some cours of action so that he doesn t wind up go first and get caught in the crossfir between the arbock and the cabl compani and the televis network in f c c world thi is known as the powel doctrin of telecom after colin powel s idea that the unit state should never commit itself militarili without a clear object overwhelm forc and an exit strategi and anoth is that he actual believ what he sai and think the telecommun crash is natur healthi and irrevers and more concentr would be just fine thi is why elect matter reed hundt who isn t happi about what ha becom of hi telecom act told me it s true that the f c c uch more than sai the war in afghanistan a case in which a gore administr would be act quit differ from the bush administr consum might have notic the differ by now but there s no question whether commun compani have notic the arbock ar do better against their intern rival than thei would have done if gore had won next elect thei ll help the parti that help them if the republican win polici will tilt further in the arbock favor if thei lose perhap the arbock rivalsh long distanc compani and the telecommun upstartsith their friend now in power will stage a comeback america s present is not unrecogniz differ from america s past gregori alan bolcer cto work number number number number gbolcer at endeavor
